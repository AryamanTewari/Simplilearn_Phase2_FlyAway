# Simplilearn_Phase2_FlyAway
FlyAway (An Airline Booking Portal)
# DESCRIPTION  
# Project objective:   
As a Full Stack Developer, design and develop an airline booking portal named as FlyAway. Use the GitHub repository to manage the project artifacts.      
# Background of the problem statement:  
FlyAway is a ticket-booking portal that lets people book flights on their website.     The website needs to have the following features:   
* A search form in the homepage to allow entry of travel details, like the date of travel, source, destination, and the number of persons.
* Based on the travel details entered, it will show the available flights with their ticket prices.
* Once a person selects a flight to book, they will be taken to a register page where they must fill in their personal details. In the next page, they are shown the flight details of the flight that they are booking, and the payment is done via a dummy payment gateway. On completion of the payment, they are shown a confirmation page with the details of the booking.
       
For the above features to work, there will be an admin backend with the following features:  
* An admin login page where the admin can change the password after login, if he wishes 
* A master list of places for source and destination 
* A master list of airlines 
* A list of flights where each flight has a source, destination, airline, and ticket price
       
The goal of the company is to deliver a high-end quality product as early as possible.     

# The flow and features of the application:  
* Plan more than two sprints to complete the application 
* Document the flow of the application and prepare a flow chart  
* List the core concepts and algorithms being used to complete this application 
* Implement the appropriate concepts, such as exceptions, collections, and sorting techniques for source code optimization and increased performance
